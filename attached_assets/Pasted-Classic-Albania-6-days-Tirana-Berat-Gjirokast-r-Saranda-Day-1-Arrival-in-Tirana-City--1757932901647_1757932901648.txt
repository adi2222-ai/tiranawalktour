Quick tweak suggestions (so you can mix & match)

If you need to cut a day: combine arrival city orientation with a half-day sightseeing (Tirana morning + afternoon transfer to next stop).

For long transfers, use internal flights (where available) or overnight train/bus options to save daytime hours.

Keep one “relax” beach or leisure afternoon on every 5–6 day plan so the tour doesn’t feel rushed.

Offer optional add-ons (e.g., cooking class in Berat, traditional music night, small-boat coastal cruise) rather than fixed inclusions to keep schedules tight.
